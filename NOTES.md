## Pull Request WorkFlow
- Begin by doing a ```git pull``` to get the latest content on your master branch
- Run ```git branch your-feature-name``` to make a git branch
- Code in your changes, add and commit the files
- Pull the master branch again and merge it with your new branch
- Push the branch up to github and submit it as a pull request
- That pull request can now receive comments and code discussion, as well as accept new commits before being merged in with the master branch
